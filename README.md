# Forcasting Electricity Consumption

## Description

This repository contains a group project for the Introduction to Data Science course of the University of Tartu.
Project will be undertaken by 
- Chigozie Nkwocha
- Wei-Chieh Wang
- Patricia Kika Obinwanne.

## Introduction

Since the Russian invasion on Ukraine, energy, rent and food costs have skyrocketed. World economies are now faced with reocrd high losses in revenue. Workers are now being laid off because their employers are no longer capable of paying their salaries in order to cut costs, small businesses are now closed due to increased operational costs. As a result, consumers of electricity around the world are now seeking for better ways of reducing electricity costs and conserving energy, since electricity contributes to the carbon footprints in the environment. One strategy is the control of electrical appliances and electronics. Another is the use of solar panels and other forms of electricity.

## Aim
In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model capable of forcasting electricity consumption for a household for the next 7 days. We intend that this project will enable consumers understand their electricity usage and identify the hour(s) of the day when usage is high or least. 

## Objective
- Use Data visualisation to understand electricity consumption of household
- Develop at least two machine learning models to predict electricity consumption
- Compare classical time series model (ARIMA) with machine learning model
- Forcast electricity consumption for the next 7 days

## Data
To accomplish this, we will use a historical dataset containing a household's hourly electricity consumption used between Sept 1st, 2021 to 24th August, 2022. A holdout test set is kept to be used for forecasting.
